## 1. Project Overview

This is a quiz application focused on the Edo period of Japan. It's a single-page application built with React and Vite. The backend is powered by Supabase, which handles user authentication and quiz data.

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend:** Supabase
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (inferred from `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` in `package.json`) and Radix UI components.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Supabase account and project.

### Installation

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Supabase Setup

1.  Create a new Supabase project.
2.  In your Supabase project, create a `quizzes` table with the following columns:
    - `id` (uuid, primary key)
    - `question` (text)
    - `answer` (text)
    - `options` (jsonb)
    - `explanation` (text)
    - `order` (int)
3.  Create a `user_answers` table with the following columns:
    - `id` (uuid, primary key)
    - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to `auth.users`)
    - `quiz_id` (uuid, foreign key to `quizzes`)
    - `answer` (text)
    - `is_correct` (boolean)
4.  Create a `quiz_completions` table with the following columns:
    - `id` (uuid, primary key)
    - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to `auth.users`)
    - `correct_count` (int)
    - `total_quizzes` (int)
5.  Create a file named `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx` and add your Supabase project information:

    ```typescript
    /* AUTOGENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT CONTENTS */

    export const projectId = "YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID";
    export const publicAnonKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY";
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID"` and `"YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY"` with your actual Supabase project ID and public anonymous key.

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

1.  Build the application for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The production-ready files will be in the `build` directory.

## 3. Development Conventions

### Supabase Integration

- The Supabase client is initialized in `src/utils/supabase/client.ts`.
- The Supabase project ID and public anonymous key are stored in `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx`.

### Components

- UI components are located in `src/components/ui`.
- The main application logic is in `src/App.tsx`.
- The `QuizCard` component (`src/components/QuizCard.tsx`) is responsible for displaying a single quiz question and handling user interaction. It displays the quiz question and choices (for multiple-choice questions) or a text input field. When the user answers, it shows whether the answer was correct, the correct answer, and an explanation. It also provides navigation to the next question.

### API Client

- An API client is defined in `src/utils/api-client.ts` to interact with the backend.
- The API client uses the Supabase client to make requests to the database.
- The available API client methods are:
  - `login(name, password)`: Authenticates a user.
  - `signup(name, password)`: Creates a new user.
  - `getQuizzes()`: Fetches all quizzes.
  - `getCategories()`: Fetches all categories.
  - `saveAnswer(quizId, userAnswer, isCorrect)`: Saves a user's answer.
  - `completeQuiz(correctCount, totalQuestions)`: Records a quiz completion.
  - `getStats()`: Fetches user statistics.
  - `getHistory()`: Fetches the user's answer history.

### Backend

- The backend is a Deno serverless function using the Hono framework.
- It is located in `supabase/functions/make-server-856c5cf0/index.ts`.
- **Authentication:** The backend uses Supabase Auth. It converts usernames to a local email format (`@quizapp.local`) for use with Supabase's email/password authentication.
- **Data Storage:** The application uses a Key-Value (KV) store for all data, including quizzes, categories, user profiles, and stats. The data is initialized with default values if the store is empty. The KV store is implemented using a Supabase table named `kv_store_856c5cf0`, and the logic for this is in `supabase/functions/make-server-856c5cf0/kv_store.ts`. Each key-value pair is a row in the table.
- **API Endpoints:** The backend defines several API endpoints that correspond to the methods in the `api-client.ts` file.

### Frontend Authentication Flow

- The authentication flow is handled by the `src/components/Auth.tsx` component.
- **UI:** The component displays a form with fields for "name" and "password". It can switch between "Login" and "Signup" modes.
- **Submission:** When the form is submitted, it calls either the `apiClient.login` or `apiClient.signup` method.
- **Signup:** After a successful signup, the component automatically logs in the new user.
- **Login:** Upon successful login, the `accessToken` is stored in `localStorage`, and the `onAuthSuccess` callback is called with the `accessToken` and user's name.
- **Error Handling:** The component displays any errors that occur during the authentication process.
